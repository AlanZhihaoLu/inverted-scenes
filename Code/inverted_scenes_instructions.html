<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people perceive real-world visual scenes like this:</p>

<p><span style="text-align: center;"></span><strong style="text-align: center;">Real-world visual scene example</strong></p>

<p><br>
<strong>Procedures</strong><br>
These instructions will also be repeated at the beginning of the experiment.<br><br>
If you agree to take part in this study, you will be presented with a series of images of real-world scenes like the one above. 
These images will appear on screen only very briefly, so it is important to keep focused throughout the duration of the experiment. 
<br><br>
Following scene presentation, a pattern (such as the one shown below) will be briefly flashed on screen.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-align: center;"></span><strong style="text-align: center;">Pattern example</strong></p>
<p><br>Your task will be to indicate whether the scene contained a particular object.</p>
<p>Below, you will see the procedure of an example experiment trial.<br>In this example, we ask whether there was a microwave in the scene.</p>

<p><span style="text-align: center;"></span><strong style="text-align: center;">Example trial procedure</strong></p>
<p><br>You will be asked to answer using your keyboard, pressing either the "1" or "2" key on your keyboard.
<br>Pressing "1" indicates that there was a microwave <b>present</b> in the scene.
<br>Similarly, pressing "2" indicates that a microwave was <b>not present</b> in the scene.</p>
<p>Additionally, scene images will sometimes be presented upside-down, as shown below:</p>

<p><span style="text-align: center;"></span><strong style="text-align: center;">Upside-down scene example</strong></p>
<p><br>These trials will likely be especially difficult, but please try your best.</p>

<p>The experiment consists of 120 scenes and will take approximately 30 minutes or less.<br>This study will be conducted with an online Qualtrics-created survey.</p>

<p><strong>Risks/Discomforts</strong><br>
Risks are minimal for involvement in this study. The only foreseeable risk in this study is the possiblity of boredom.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Compensation</strong><br>
Participants will earn 0.5 SONA credits if they complete&nbsp;all 120 trials of the&nbsp;task. Completed items are those that are rated in good faith by a human observer. Participants selecting all of the same rating and/or&nbsp;randomly selecting ratings (i.e., 'spamming') will not receive credit.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong><br>
There are no direct benefits for participants besides the SONA credit. However, it is hoped that through your participation, researchers will learn more about how we visually process complex visual scenes.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>
All data obtained from participants will be kept strictly confidential and will only be reported in an aggregate format (by reporting only combined results and never reporting individual ones). All questionnaires will be concealed, and no one other than then primary investigator and assistant researches listed below will have access to them. The data collected will be stored in the HIPPA-compliant, secure database until it has been deleted by the primary investigator.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Institution Review Board (IRB) Approved</b><br>
An Institutional Review Board responsible for human subjects research at the University of California, Davis reviewed this research project and found it to be acceptable according to applicable state and federal regulations and University policies designed to protect the rights and welfare of participants in research.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
